From the GitHub starter guide.
My name is Aurora and I am a PhD student at Texas A&M University. Though Tamu is soon to be my alma mater, my blood runs purple and gold!!! Geaux LSU!
Anyway, I am nearing the end of my long academic career and am now on the job hunt. I have have an impressive (at least to me) set of tools in my toolbox and am looking for the right quantitative job to both challenge and engage me. Maybe you can be the lucky employer!
